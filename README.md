# Malaria Plasmodium Illumina Amplicon Workspace

This workspace contains workflows for processing *Plasmodium* amplicon sequencing data using Illumina platforms in the Terra platform. It is panel-agnostic and includes two main workflows:

- **01_Illumina_Amplicon_Processing**: Preprocesses raw reads, removes sequencing errors (denoising), and prepares data for genotyping.
- **02_Plasmodium_Genotype_Population_Analysis**: Performs genotype analysis and produces summary reports, including frequency maps of drug resistance.

Reference data and example datasets for multiple panels (e.g. MAD4HatTeR, AMPLseq, SIMPLseq) are included.
